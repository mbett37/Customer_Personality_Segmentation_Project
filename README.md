Customer Segmentation Project
Overview

This project aims to identify distinct customer segments to optimize marketing efficiency and enhance the customer experience. By understanding the characteristics, preferences, and behaviors of each group, the company can:

Develop personalized marketing campaigns.

Implement effective retention strategies for high-value customers.

Optimize resource allocation, including inventory management, pricing strategies, and store layouts.

Objective

As a data scientist, the main goals of this project are:

Analyze the customer dataset to identify meaningful clusters.

Apply machine learning techniques for customer segmentation.

Provide actionable insights into the characteristics and behaviors of each segment.

Recommend strategies to improve marketing effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

Methodology

Data Analysis: Explored customer demographics, spending habits, purchasing channels, and campaign responses.

Clustering Techniques: Applied unsupervised learning methods (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers into distinct groups.

Segment Profiling: Identified key characteristics, behaviors, and spending patterns for each cluster.

Business Recommendations: Derived actionable strategies based on cluster insights.

Key Findings

Two distinct clusters were identified:

Cluster 1

Older, more affluent, more educated, fewer small children, more likely married.

Higher spending and longer tenure with the company.

More likely to respond to marketing campaigns.

Prefers catalog shopping over online browsing.

Spends less time online per visit, likely because purchases are efficient and high-value.

Cluster 0

Younger, less affluent, more economic stress.

Lower spending and shorter tenure.

More likely to complain and actively seek deals online.

Campaign 3 was particularly effective for this group.

Business Recommendations
Tailored Marketing

Cluster 1: Emphasize quality, exclusivity, and premium products. Implement a loyalty program rewarding high spenders. Maintain consistent communication to reinforce value.

Cluster 0: Focus on value deals, promotions, and products relevant to families. Investigate why Campaign 3 was more effective to retain these customers.

Customer Experience & Layout

Stock high-value products in areas accessible to Cluster 1; group value-oriented products for Cluster 0.

Design store or online layouts tailored to each cluster:

Cluster 1: High-end feel, premium product placement.

Cluster 0: Family-oriented, emphasize bargains and promotions.

Customer Support

Address Cluster 0 complaints promptly to build trust.

Offer loyalty incentives tied to repeat purchases for both clusters.

Continuous Monitoring

Regularly assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and store layouts.

Refine strategies as customer behavior and preferences evolve.

Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Techniques: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), K-Means Clustering, Customer Profiling, Business Recommendations

Conclusion

Customer segmentation reveals meaningful differences between Cluster 1 and Cluster 0. By tailoring marketing strategies, optimizing store layouts, and addressing customer needs, the company can increase conversion rates, enhance retention, and improve overall customer satisfaction. Continuous monitoring and refinement of these strategies will ensure long-term effectiveness.
